**Project Overview:**

The MotorsCertification Database Enhancement project focuses on optimizing and extending an existing database system. The primary objectives include improving performance, ensuring data integrity, and enhancing security. The project involves schema design, data insertion, querying, view creation, stored procedure development, trigger implementation, and user role management.


**Key Tasks:**

**Database Design:** Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) model and design tables to accommodate data related to orders, customers, employees, products, offices, payments, and product lines.

**Data Insertion:** Populate the tables with data in a specific order to establish data relationships.

**Performance Optimization:** Optimize query performance and indexes to reduce response times.

**Data Integrity:** Implement data validation and integrity checks to ensure accuracy and consistency.

**Security Enhancements:** Strengthen data security through access controls, encryption, and auditing mechanisms.

**Reporting and Analytics:** Develop a reporting and analytics platform on top of the database for informed decision-making.

**User Management:** Create roles (Admin, HR, Employee), logins, and users, and configure permissions accordingly.

**Stored Procedures and Functions:** Develop a stored procedure to retrieve product lines and a function to assess customer credit limits.

**Triggers:** Create triggers to capture transaction records for employees and identify high-value customers.

**Project Benefits:**
The MotorsCertification Database Enhancement project aims to modernize the database infrastructure, enhance security, and improve data handling. By optimizing performance and ensuring data integrity, the project sets the stage for more efficient and secure data management.
